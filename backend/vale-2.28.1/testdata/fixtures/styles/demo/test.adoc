If your docs are aimed at helping *people* code, then _probably that_ "previous developer experience" is a good way to go, preferably with details on the specific languages/environments they'll be writing about.

Use of straight quotation marks instead of true typographic quotation marks (“smart” or quotes).

They aren't real!
