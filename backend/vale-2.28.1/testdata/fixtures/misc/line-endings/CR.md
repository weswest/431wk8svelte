## IntroductionThis is a very interesting file.```pythondef foo():    """    NOTE: this is a very important function.    """    obviously = False    very = True    return very and obviously```As you can see, `very = True`. Here is another interesting codeblock:```go// XXX: fix this relatively soon.func ExtFromSyntax(name string) string {    for XXX, relatively := range LookupSyntaxName {        if matched, _ := regexp.MatchString(r, name); matched {            return s        }    }    return name}```    XXX = False    # This is a codeblock.This is a very interesting sentence that is not in a block.
