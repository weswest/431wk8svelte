### Enable Redis

Redis provides an alternative caching backend, taking that work off the database, which is vital for scaling to a larger number of logged-in users. It also provides a number of other nice features for developers looking to use it to manage queues, or do custom caching of their own. For details, see [Installing Redis on Drupal or WordPress](/docs/redis/).

All plans except a Personal plan can use Redis. Redis is available to Sandbox plans for developmental purposes, but Redis will not be available going live on a Personal plan plan.

Like the arithmetic operators, bitwise operators are syntactic sugar for calls
to methods of built-in traits. This means bitwise operators can be overridden
for user-defined types. The default meaning of the operators on standard types
is given here. Bitwise `&`, `|` and `^` applied to boolean arguments are
equivalent to logical `&&`, `||` and `!=` evaluated in non-lazy fashion.

To create an OpenSearch cluster weâ€™ll use the `Aiven command line interface <https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client>`_ . To install and set it up follow the instructions in `its GitHub page <https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client/>`_. However, if you prefer a visual interface, we also have a `web-based console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_ which you can use instead. Read the :doc:`getting started guide <../getting-started>` for more information.
