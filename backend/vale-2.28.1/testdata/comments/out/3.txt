Package lint implments Vale's syntax-aware linting functionality.
The package is split into core linting logic (this file), source code
(code.go), and markup (markup.go).
Println formats using the default formats for its oprands and writes to
standard output.

Spaces are always added between operands and a newline is appended.

It returns the number of bytes written and any write error encountered.
