In today's digital age, data is crucial. Data drives most decisions, from business strategies to personal choices. However, there's often confusion about how to treat the word "data" in written English.

Traditionally, "data" is the plural form of "datum." This means that when referring to multiple pieces of information, one would say, "The data are clear." On the other hand, if referring to a single piece of information, the correct usage would be, "This datum is clear."

However, modern usage has evolved. Many people now treat "data" as a singular noun, especially in the context of digital information. For example, "The data is being processed" or "This data shows a significant trend."

Google's style guide provides clarity on many such issues. It's a comprehensive resource that offers guidance on grammar, punctuation, and word choice. Adhering to a style guide ensures consistency and clarity in written communication.

This app respects individual preferences. Users can choose whether they want to treat "data" as a singular or plural noun. This customization ensures that documents align with the writer's intent.

For instance, consider the sentence, "The data is compelling." If a user prefers the traditional approach, the tool flags this as an error. Conversely, if the preference is for modern usage, the sentence "The data show a rising trend" would be highlighted.

In conclusion, language is dynamic, and its usage evolves over time. While it's essential to respect traditional rules, it's equally important to acknowledge contemporary practices. The tool aims to bridge this gap, offering flexibility while maintaining adherence to the Google style guide.

This text triggers the singular or plural rule for "data" based on the user's preference. If the user chooses the traditional approach (data as plural), the sentences "The data is being processed" and "The data is compelling" is flagged. If the user opts for the modern usage (data as singular), the sentence "The data show a rising trend" is highlighted.
